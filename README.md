    REPOSITORY: somerepository
    ACCESS_TOKEN: et984tnGHtet829je
    SECRET_NAME: SOME_SECRET
    SECRET_VALUE: <output-from-previous-step>
```

<i>where</i>

`OWNER` is the owner of the repository where the secret is to be created or updated. <b>Required</b>.

`REPOSITORY` is the name of the respository where the secret is to be created or updated. <b>Required</b>.

`ACCESS_TOKEN` is the personal access token to use for authentication against the repository where the secret is stored. Using `secrets.GIHUB_TOKEN` will not work. Follo steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create one if you dont already have one. Besure to allow the token to be used to read user public keys<b>Required</b>.

`SECRET_NAME` is the name of the secret to be created or updated. <b>Required</b>.

`SECRET_VALUE` is value the secret should be set to. <b>Optional</b>. This should be an output from a previous step or job(https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs). !!! DO NOT HARDCODE THIS, NOT SECURE !!!


To view the newly created secret, navigate to settings >> secrets >> actions in the Github repository portal.
## Motivation

I wanted to use the [kubectl-aws-eks](https://github.com/kodermax/kubectl-aws-eks) github action to manage my AWS EKS cluster and it required that I pass the kubenetes configuration to the `KUBE_CONFIG_DATA` variable. This configuration happened to be an ouput of a terraform routine I use to set up the EKS cluster so I wanted a way to persist the kubenetes configuration and access it later when I needed to maintain the cluster.

The solution to that challenge is what I have shared in this github action.
